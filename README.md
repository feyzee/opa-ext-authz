# OPA External Authorization

Within this repo are various examples of OPA as an external authorization engine for HTTP based applications and microservices.

All examples are inspired by, and derivative of, the official OPA docs - specifically:
* [HTTP API Authorization with OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/http-api-authorization/)
* [Envoy Authorization with OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-introduction/)
